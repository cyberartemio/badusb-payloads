## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction
In this repository you can find some BadUSB payloads that I wrote. The payloads are mainly designed to be executed on OMG devices or on Flipper Zero, but with some changes they should work also on Rubber Ducky.

### Structure of the repo
In the root directory there are various folders representing the categories of the payloads. *The logic is the same that is followed by Hak5 payloads repos.*

Inside each category's directory, you'll find a folder for each payload with its name..

Finally, inside the directory of the payload, you'll find the actual BadUSB payload (generally 2 versions, one for OMG and one for Flipper), optionally resources supporting it, and a `README.md` file with a detailed description of what it does and how to use it.
